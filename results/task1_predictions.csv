baseline,"While doing a bicycle ride to the Orange Table, I pointed to a friend that LuLus Cupcakes was accessbile from our bike path. She immediately exclaimed- ""we are SO there tomorrow!""

Today, I get a phone call at 4pm, saying she is picking me up to go get those damn cupcakes. She was serious! Since I had off and she got off early, we were able to visit the holy mecca of cupcake land. She picked me up in what may be one of the most ridiculous blue convertables known to man and we zoomed up to Scottsdale, blasting bad hip hop, psyched about individual iced cakes!

Upon arrival, the space was sparse and very IKEA-ish. Pinks and lime greens dominate the palate. To the right of the counter was t-shirts, rubber duckies and other merch. They do have a brown with orange stripes guy shirt...in XL. I guess big men love cupcakes!

But the real star are the cupcakes themselves...lovingly displayed under glass domes. Carrot cakes, german chocolate cake, mocha chocolate cake, blonde (vanilla on vanilla), chocolate on vanilla, and the special of the day key lime....oh man. MERCY. I kept dodging between the carrot and the mocha and went for the Mocha. All natural ingrediants and VEGAN sprinkles! (But very much all dairy icings, btw). Our lady, I think Melissa, was super helpful and even offered samplings of cupcakes to help us decide. She put each individual cupcake in a plastic bubble and in a cute lime green/pink dotted bag. She noted they do have mini cupcakes for events (OMG) and I would totally splurge for those suckers. 

The only real negative (besides times..I mean if this place was open late, it would be HEAVEN) was the lack of drink choices. Coffee, milk or water. Um..I mean, I dont knew a bazillion options, but even tea would have been nice. I chose hot coffee which was fine. But iced coffee as an option would have been kick ass...or lime rickeys! OMG!

As an FYI, you can leave the strip mall complex and head down to the park and eat your delectables under  a shaded tree on a park bench over looking a ""pond"" like we did. I savoured my 2.95 cupcake, and the icing and cake was perfect. I cant even describe how yummy it was. It was worth every cent. And they arent gigantic, so you feel perfectly satisfied with your cupcake.

baseline,"Went here today Sunday about 8:50 and it was crowded but not to bad, about 1/2 hour wait. Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. 

About 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. 
My grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. 
There was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes.
Id like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast",5,,False,"404 models/gemini-1.5-pro is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent.

baseline,"I am a very loyal customer to pure sushi and have been for over 2 years now. Up until about 6 months ago I would have given this place 4, possibly 5 stars, but with the horrible service I have encountered the last 6 months I'm only giving it 2. Normally I order my food to go at the bar and just take it home and eat it. But the for the last 6 months when I go in to order my food at the bar, its always the same bar tender working and she is rude. The last 3 times I have been into order food I ended up just walking out and not ordering anything. She is always taking to what seems to be her friends at the bar. I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her ""friend"" or whoever at the bar for 15 minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all. Now I totally understand if this happens once in a while, but it has happened every time I have gone in there for the past 6 months. I feel almost as if I were betrayed, I was such a loyal customer and referred so many people to Pure, I just hope they don't receive the same kind of service I do.",2,,False,"404 models/gemini-1.5-pro is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent.

baseline,"I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place.
The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review.

baseline,"I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.

Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.

The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.

While we waited we were given a bowl of the ""house soup"" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.

The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I ""blame"" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.

The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. 

My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.

The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.

The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. 

Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.

Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. 

Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.

So... tasty, some major standouts, some ""meh, I've had this before."" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return.

M&S has to have one of the best happy hours in the world, aside from Spearmint Rhino. $3 drafts and a rotating $2 bar food menu, such as 1/2 lb. burger with fries, hot wings, fish tacos, beef taquitos, etc. don't order the fish chilli though, it tastes like A1 sauce. they got a lot of winners on tap, like kiltlifter, guinness, bass, fat tire, pyramid hefe, etc.



happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget.

baseline,"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks.

baseline,"With a name like ""The Lodge"", I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals. We went here after a soccer game two weeks ago, and I have to say, I thought I was going to be disappointed. I expected greasy food, and grimy scenery. This was not the case, although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife. I had a great sandwich I believe called the healthy choice, that was supposedly was healthy? It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I don't think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny. They need to enforce the shirt and shoes required law here otherwise it will earn a lodgey reputation from me.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Up until about 6 months ago I would have given this place 4, possibly 5 stars, but with the horrible service I have encountered the last 6 months I'm only giving it 2. Normally I order my food to go at the bar and just take it home and eat it. But the for the last 6 months when I go in to order my food at the bar, its always the same bar tender working and she is rude. The last 3 times I have been into order food I ended up just walking out and not ordering anything. She is always taking to what seems to be her friends at the bar. I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her ""friend"" or whoever at the bar for 15 minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all. Now I totally understand if this happens once in a while, but it has happened every time I have gone in there for the past 6 months.

The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review.

cot,"I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.

Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.

The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.

While we waited we were given a bowl of the ""house soup"" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.

The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I ""blame"" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.

The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. 

My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.

The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.

The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. 

Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.

Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. 

Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.

So... tasty, some major standouts, some ""meh, I've had this before."" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return.

cot,"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

cot,"With a name like ""The Lodge"", I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals. We went here after a soccer game two weeks ago, and I have to say, I thought I was going to be disappointed. I expected greasy food, and grimy scenery. This was not the case, although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife. I had a great sandwich I believe called the healthy choice, that was supposedly was healthy? It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I don't think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Today, I get a phone call at 4pm, saying she is picking me up to go get those damn cupcakes. She was serious! Since I had off and she got off early, we were able to visit the holy mecca of cupcake land. She picked me up in what may be one of the most ridiculous blue convertables known to man and we zoomed up to Scottsdale, blasting bad hip hop, psyched about individual iced cakes!

Upon arrival, the space was sparse and very IKEA-ish. Pinks and lime greens dominate the palate. To the right of the counter was t-shirts, rubber duckies and other merch. They do have a brown with orange stripes guy shirt...in XL. I guess big men love cupcakes!

But the real star are the cupcakes themselves...lovingly displayed under glass domes. Carrot cakes, german chocolate cake, mocha chocolate cake, blonde (vanilla on vanilla), chocolate on vanilla, and the special of the day key lime....oh man. MERCY. I kept dodging between the carrot and the mocha and went for the Mocha. All natural ingrediants and VEGAN sprinkles! (But very much all dairy icings, btw). Our lady, I think Melissa, was super helpful and even offered samplings of cupcakes to help us decide. She put each individual cupcake in a plastic bubble and in a cute lime green/pink dotted bag. She noted they do have mini cupcakes for events (OMG) and I would totally splurge for those suckers. 

The only real negative (besides times..I mean if this place was open late, it would be HEAVEN) was the lack of drink choices. Coffee, milk or water. Um..I mean, I dont knew a bazillion options, but even tea would have been nice. I chose hot coffee which was fine. But iced coffee as an option would have been kick ass...or lime rickeys! OMG!

selfcheck,"I am a very loyal customer to pure sushi and have been for over 2 years now. Up until about 6 months ago I would have given this place 4, possibly 5 stars, but with the horrible service I have encountered the last 6 months I'm only giving it 2. Normally I order my food to go at the bar and just take it home and eat it. But the for the last 6 months when I go in to order my food at the bar, its always the same bar tender working and she is rude. The last 3 times I have been into order food I ended up just walking out and not ordering anything. She is always taking to what seems to be her friends at the bar. I always know what I want right when I go in, so there is no need for a menu, she greets me and hands me a menu totally ignoring me telling her that I already knew what I wanted. Then she precedes to talk to her ""friend"" or whoever at the bar for 15 minutes before taking my order. I know all of her personal business and even what she plans on wearing to her friends wedding in a few weeks. The food is good, but considering there are so many other really great sushi places with so much better customer services i would not recommend this place at all. Now I totally understand if this happens once in a while, but it has happened every time I have gone in there for the past 6 months. I feel almost as if I were betrayed, I was such a loyal customer and referred so many people to Pure, I just hope they don't receive the same kind of service I do.",2,,False,"404 models/gemini-1.5-pro is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent.

selfcheck,"I don't often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place.
The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I don't like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I can't seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis' class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review.

selfcheck,"I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.

Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.

The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.

While we waited we were given a bowl of the ""house soup"" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.

The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I ""blame"" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.

The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. 

My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.

The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.

The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. 

Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.

Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. 

Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.

So... tasty, some major standouts, some ""meh, I've had this before."" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return.

happy hour is from 3p-6p and then again from 9p-11p, which is pure genius. make sure you get your parking ticket balidated, because the Eritrean girl in the parking garage will make you go back in the restaurant and get that joint stamped if you forget.

selfcheck,"Ok, so I have to share my morning experience. But first I must start off by saying this: I'm no moron. Honest. 

So, this morning I stopped for gas. My tank was getting dangerously low and there was no way I'd make it to work. That's okay, for I allotted time this morning for re-filling my tank. From my casa, I turned East on Indian School, vaguely remembering there's a Quick Trip nearby. Perfect. I had stopped there before. 

But it wasn't a Quick Trip I saw at the corner of Central and Indian School. Not wanting to risk running out of gas, I opted to stop here, at this ampm station. 

I pulled up to the closest gas tank, got out of my car, took off my gas cap and reached for the gas nozzle. Only then I discovered there was no pay-at-the-pump option. The short notice on the pump said to select my grade and start filling. ""Wow,"" I thought, ""It's so odd for a station to trust people - especially in this area - to not drive off without paying."" 

So, I followed the instructions, but nothing happened. I kept hitting the grade button. It kept beeping back at me. Still nothing. To top it off (no pun intended), the nozzle was wrapped in this huge rubber tube thing that compressed when I applied pressure to the handle. I had never seen anything like it. 

Thinking my particular pump was fuct up, I pulled my car up to the next one. That's when I saw it - this strange machine, like an Amtrack ticket dispenser. I approached with curiously. That's when I realized. You swipe your card at this central machine (or deposit cash, if that's your preference) and then go back to your pump. Ah-ha. This is how this station works. So, I did just that. I punched in my gas pump number (4) and went back to my car to re-fill the tank. Already annoyed at this point, I figured I'd pump enough gas to get me through the next couple of days. 

Only, it wasn't pumping. The long rubber thingy was hindering my ability to hook the nozzle up to my gas tank. UGH. So, that's when I flexed my muscles and applied enough pressure to squeeze out $12 worth of gas. Then I re-hooked the nozzle on its perch and walked back to the strange machine for my receipt - it told me to do so when I swiped my card. Only, no receipt came out. I punched the keypad with defiance and walked off. 

Stupid ampm station. Since when does any gas station benefit from being different? I'm so used to pay-at-the-pump; you just swipe your card, select your grade, pump your gas, grab your receipt and go. Quick Trip doesn't torment me like this. There is no rubber nozzle thingy in my way. Grr. Screw this. I'm never going back there again.

I do wish that they would lose the styrofoam soda cups and offer more than one size of drinks.

selfcheck,"With a name like ""The Lodge"", I thought I was going to an old dirty restaurant with some of the neighborhood locals. We went here after a soccer game two weeks ago, and I have to say, I thought I was going to be disappointed. I expected greasy food, and grimy scenery. This was not the case, although the scenery was mildly disturbing as most of the decor included some dearly departed wildlife. I had a great sandwich I believe called the healthy choice, that was supposedly was healthy? It came on this great thick toasted buttery whole grain bread, egg whites, hollindase sauce, tomato and avocado. It was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. I don't think it was a calorie saver by any means but I am sure it was just the idea it was made with healthier ingredients. For a lodge, this was a terrific restaurant, and yes this is a compliment by far, joking aside, as you remember my thoughts of what a lodge was all about. This is nothing like the local VFW. The only other scary part was this jerk at the bar decided to take his shirt off, and throw it across the room. And ladies, no, this was definitely not a pretty sight nor was it funny. They need to enforce the shirt and shoes required law here otherwise it will earn a lodgey reputation from me.

What is a pasty?

A pasty's history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.
